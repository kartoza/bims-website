[![Biodiversity Records](./img/landing-page-img-2.png)](./img/landing-page-img-2.png)

1. This section displays the sample image of a species, the total number of records associated with it, and the total number of sites where it has been observed.

2. This section contains the user activities, such as the number of users who have viewed the species, the number of users who have downloaded the species data etc.

#### Meaning of different colours:

##### In case of Fish, Anurans, Invertebrates, Plants

- <span style="color: teal; font-weight: bold;">Teal</span>: This colour signifies the lowest level of `concern`, typically indicating a species is stable and does not require immediate intervention. It represents a safe status with minimal risk.

- <span style="color: crimson; font-weight: bold;">Crimson Red</span>: This signifies the highest level of being `critically endangered`, indicating that the species is at an extremely high risk of extinction. Immediate and significant conservation or intervention efforts are required to prevent loss.

- <span style="color: #285B7B; font-weight: bold;">Teal Blue</span>: Teal blue is associated with the highest level of being `near-threatened`, meaning the species is facing potential threats and could become endangered without further action. It calls for monitoring and proactive conservation measures.

- <span style="color: #18B9A6; font-weight: bold;">Tropical Rainforest</span>: This colour is used to denote a status of `not evaluated`. It indicates that no official assessment has been conducted yet regarding the species, so its conservation status remains unclear.

- <span style="color: #990B30; font-weight: bold;">Ruby Red</span>: Ruby red signifies the highest level of being `endangered`. This colour indicates that the species is at serious risk of extinction in the near future unless action is taken. Conservation efforts are urgent and critical.

- <span style="color: #4A4B48; font-weight: bold;">Charcoal Gray</span>: This colour represents the highest level of being `vulnerable`, meaning that the species faces a high degree of risk and is at significant threat, though not as immediate as being endangered. Vulnerable statuses often require ongoing protection efforts.

- <span style="color: #FAEA05; font-weight: bold;">Daffodil Yellow</span>: Daffodil yellow is used to signify a level of `data deficiency`, indicating that there is insufficient information available to determine the full status or health of a species. Further research and data collection are needed for proper evaluation.

- <span style="color: #E60000; font-weight: bold;">Vivid Red</span>: Vivid red signals a `poor level`, typically representing species that are in dire condition or exhibiting signs of severe deterioration. Immediate action is necessary to prevent further decline.

- <span style="color: #E69500; font-weight: bold;">Golden Yellow</span>: Golden yellow represents a `fair level`, indicating that the species is somewhat stable, but there may still be areas that need attention or improvement to maintain its status.

- <span style="color: #007500; font-weight: bold;">Green</span>: Green signifies a `good level`, meaning the species is in a healthy, stable condition with no significant threats. This status is often ideal and indicates that everything is functioning well.

- <span style="color: #0000E6; font-weight: bold;">Blue</span>: Blue is used to represent a `natural level`, indicating that the species is at a baseline, typical state, not subject to significant human influence or immediate threats. It reflects a balanced, sustainable condition.

- <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Black</span>: Black signifies a `rare level`, representing species that are infrequently encountered. This colour may indicate a state of scarcity or a unique status that demands special attention.

##### In case of Algae

- <span style="color: #1D4359; font-weight: bold;">Dark Slate Blue</span>: This colour signifies the level of `Bacillariophyta`, a group of microscopic algae commonly known as diatoms. These organisms are crucial for aquatic ecosystems as they contribute significantly to primary production and form the base of many food webs. They are characterised by their silica cell walls, which exhibit intricate patterns and designs.

- <span style="color: #18B9A6; font-weight: bold;">Tropical Rainforest</span>: This colour represents the level of `Euglenophyta`, a diverse group of algae that can thrive in both freshwater and marine environments. Euglenophytes are known for their unique mixotrophic capabilities, allowing them to photosynthesise like plants or ingest food particles like animals when light is insufficient.

- <span style="color: #8BBBB5; font-weight: bold;">Soft Aquamarine</span>: This colour is associated with `Xanthophyta`. These algae are found in freshwater and terrestrial environments, and their yellow-green colouration comes from the dominance of carotenoids over chlorophyll. Xanthophytes are important for studying evolutionary adaptations in algae.

- <span style="color: #FDF44E; font-weight: bold;">Lemon Yellow</span>: This colour signifies a member of the phylum `Cynophyta`, also known as cyanobacteria or blue-green algae. Despite their name, they are not true algae but prokaryotic organisms capable of photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria play a vital role in nitrogen fixation and have significantly shaped earthâ€™s atmosphere and ecosystems over billions of years.

- <span style="color: #FAEA05; font-weight: bold;">Daffodil Yellow</span>: This colour signifies a member of the phylum `Chlorophyta`, commonly referred to as green algae. Chlorophytes are photosynthetic organisms that inhabit a wide range of environments, from freshwater to marine habitats. They are closely related to land plants and are considered key to understanding plant evolution. Chlorophytes are also crucial in aquatic food chains and contribute to oxygen production.

### Platform Details

[![Information](./img/landing-page-img-3.png)](./img/landing-page-img-3.png)

1. **What is FBIS:** The FBIS is a powerful, visual, data-rich information system for hosting and serving freshwater biodiversity data in South Africa. It serves as a platform for the inventory and maintenance of data, thereby facilitating the evaluation of long-term change in freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem condition, and guiding future monitoring strategies and management decisions. Users can learn more about the platform by clicking [here](https://www.frcsa.org.za/our-work/freshwater-biodiversity-information-system-fbis/).

2. **Why Freshwater Biodiversity Matters:** Rivers and wetlands are the arteries of planet Earth. They are critical for our water security and wellbeing, but are also home to an incredible, but rarely seen, diversity of life. In South Africa, freshwaters have become more threatened than any other ecosystems and their aquatic species are disappearing faster than ever before. We have arrived at a crossroads where bending back the curve of biodiversity loss hinges on access to reliable and accessible data.

1. **Life of a Data Point:** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQkAJSDaoK8) explaining the life of a data point from collection to publication.

2. **Better data = Better decisions:** The FBIS hosts and serves high quality biodiversity data that are freely available to a wide range of stakeholders, including researchers, conservation practitioners and policy makers to support data-driven decisions. One example of how data from the FBIS is supporting better freshwater decisions in South Africa is the inclusion of FBIS-derived Freshwater Fish Sensitivity Layers in the Department of Fisheries, Forestry and the Environment (DFFE) Screening Tool - legislation used to flag biologically-sensitive areas when new developments or land use changes are proposed. Users can also read the papers by clicking [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1122223/full)

### Community Practice

[![Community Practice](./img/landing-page-img-5.png)](./img/landing-page-img-5.png)

1. The FBIS is an open and collaborative platform, designed to serve the data needs of a broad community of data users for the overarching goal of better-managing South Africa's freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity. The design of the platform was informed by inputs from data users ranging from parastatal organisations through to private consultants. The data served through the platform come from a variety of different sources ranging from databases to research reports and scientific publications.

2. **FBIS Mobile App:** A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2yADWef0sw) explaining the FBIS mobile app and its features.

### FBIS Mobile App

[![FBIS Mobile App](./img/landing-page-img-6.png)](./img/landing-page-img-6.png)

1. **FBIS Mobile App:** The FBIS mobile application is a quick and easy way to upload freshwater biodiversity data from field monitoring sites directly to the FBIS platform, eliminating the need for datasheets and spreadsheets. Biodiversity data for fish, invertebrates, algae, anurans and plants can be added for both rivers and wetlands, and SASS biomonitoring data can be added for rivers. The app mimics standard data sheets, accommodating details about sampling site, sampling method, sampling effort, environmental data, photographs, notes and more. Sampling data can be synchronized with FBIS platform when back at the office via a wifi connection, or directly from the field using mobile data. The SASS App can be downloaded for free for both Apple and Android devices.
