# Publish Spatial Layer on Map

Once you have uploaded and styled a spatial layer, you need to publish it on the BIMS instance so that it will display on the map.

As an admin/super user, access the `Visualization Layers` page by clicking on 1️⃣ your user name in the top right corner of any page and then click on 2️⃣ `Visualization Layers` on the dropdown menu.

On the `Visualization Layer` form, complete the following fields:

1. `Name`: The name that will appear in the layer selector on the map.
2. Choose the desired layer from the `Layer` dropdown list.
3. Select the appropriate style from the `Layer style` dropdown list
4. `Abstract`: A brief description displayed when clicking the `i` icon in the layer selector.
