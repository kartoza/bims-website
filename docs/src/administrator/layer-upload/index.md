* [Publish Spatial Layer on Map:](./publish-spatial-layer.md) This document describes how to publish the recently uploaded and styled spatial layer onto the map of the BIMS instance.
* [Add Spatial Filter:](./add-spatial-filter.md) This document describes how to add a spatial filter using a recently uploaded spatial layer.
